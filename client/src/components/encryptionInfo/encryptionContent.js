        title: "AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)",
        body: `Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. AES is widely used today as it is much stronger than DES and triple DES despite being harder to implement.
        
        Some important points:`,
        list: [
            "AES is a block cipher.",
            "The key size can be 128/192/256 bits.",
            "Encrypts data in blocks of 128 bits each.",
            "AES relies on substitution-permutation network principle which involves replacing and shuffling of the input data."
        ],
        conclusion: `That means it takes 128 bits as input and outputs 128 bits of encrypted cipher text as output. AES relies on substitution-permutation network principle which means it is performed using a series of linked operations which involves replacing and shuffling of the input data.`,

        title: "Blowfish",
        body: `Blowfish is an encryption technique designed by Bruce Schneier in 1993 as an alternative to DES Encryption Technique. It is significantly faster than DES and provides a good encryption rate with no effective cryptanalysis technique found to date. It is one of the first, secure block cyphers not subject to any patents and hence freely available for anyone to use. It is symmetric block cipher algorithm.
        
        Advantages and Disadvantages of Blowfish Algorithm:`,
        list: [
            "Blowfish is a fast block cipher except when changing keys. Each new key requires a pre-processing equivalent to 4KB of text.",
            "It is faster and much better than DES Encryption.",
            "Blowfish uses a 64-bit block size which makes it vulnerable to birthday attacks.",
            "A reduced round variant of blowfish is known to be susceptible to known plain text attacks. ",
            "Number of substitution boxes: 4 [each having 512 entries of 32-bits each]"
        ],
        conclusion: `Some of the applications of Blowfish are: Bulk Encryption, Packet Encryption (ATM Packets), Password Hashing`,

        key: 'ChaCha20',
        title: "ChaCha20",
        body: `ChaCha20 is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a 256-bit key for both encryption and decryption. It was developed by Daniel J. Bernstein, a renowned cryptographer, in 2008 as a stream cipher. It is designed to provide a combination of speed and security. It is constructed to resist known attacks, including differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis. Furthermore, it is highly parallelizable, making it easily adaptable to multi-core processors and other high-performance computing systems.
        
        Fundamental steps in the encryption process:`,
        list: [
            "Key Generation: The ChaCha20 algorithm generates a 256-bit key from a user-supplied key and a randomly generated 96-bit nonce.",

            "Data Encryption: ChaCha20 encrypts each data block using the state of the cipher, which is updated after processing each block.",
            "Output: The resulting ciphertext is produced by XORing the plaintext with the output of the data encryption step",
        ],
        conclusion: `Overall, ChaCha20 is a great algorithm for those seeking speed, security, parallelizability and simple implementation.`,
