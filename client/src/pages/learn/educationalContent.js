        title: "What is Cybersecurity?",
        body: "Cybersecurity refers to any technology, measure or practice for preventing cyberattacks or mitigating their impact. Cybersecurity aims to protect individuals’ and organizations’ systems, applications, computing devices, sensitive data and financial assets against computer viruses, sophisticated and costly ransomware attacks, and more. Cyberattacks have the power to disrupt, damage or destroy businesses, and the cost to victims keeps rising. By one estimate, cybercrime might cost the world economy USD 10.5 trillion per year by 2025.\n\nThe expanding information technology (IT) trends of the past few years include:",

            "Bring your own device (BYOD) programs.",
            "Connected devices and sensors in everything from doorbells to cars to assembly lines."
        ],
        conclusion: "All these trends create tremendous business advantages and human progress, but also provide exponentially more opportunities for cybercriminals to attack. \nNot surprisingly, a recent study found that the global cybersecurity worker gap—the gap between existing cybersecurity workers and cybersecurity jobs that need to be filled—was 3.4 million workers worldwide.2 Resource-strained security teams are focusing on developing comprehensive cybersecurity strategies that use advanced analytics, artificial intelligence and automation to fight cyberthreats more effectively and minimize the impact of cyberattacks.",

        title: "Common Cyber Threats",
        body: "Cyber threats come in many forms, ranging from viruses and malware to sophisticated phishing attacks and ransomware. These threats can lead to significant financial losses, the theft of personal and corporate data, and even damage to critical infrastructure. \nBy familiarizing yourself with these common dangers, you can develop a more robust defense against potential attacks, safeguarding your information and systems from unauthorized access and harm.\n\nSome of the most common Cyber Threats are:",
        list: [
            "Malware: Any software code or computer program that is written intentionally to harm a computer system or its users. Almost every modern cyberattack involves some type of malware. Hackers and cybercriminals create and use malware to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and sensitive data, hijack computer systems and operate them remotely, disrupt or damage computer systems, or hold data or systems hostage for large sums of money.\n",
            "Ransomware: A type of malware that encrypts a victim’s data or device and threatens to keep it encrypted—or worse—unless the victim pays a ransom to the attacker. According to the IBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2023, ransomware attacks represented 17 percent of all cyberattacks in 2022.'Or worse' is what distinguishes today's ransomware from its predecessors. The earliest ransomware attacks demanded a single ransom in exchange for the encryption key. Today, most ransomware attacks are double extortion attacks, demanding a second ransom to prevent sharing or publication of the victims data. Some are triple extortion attacks that threaten to launch a distributed denial of service attack if ransoms aren’t paid.\n",
            "Phishing: Phishing attacks are email, text or voice messages that trick users into downloading malware, sharing sensitive information or sending funds to the wrong people. Most users are familiar with bulk phishing scams—mass-mailed fraudulent messages that appear to be from a large and trusted brand, asking recipients to reset their passwords or reenter credit card information. But more sophisticated phishing scams, such as spear phishing and business email compromise (BEC), target specific individuals or groups to steal especially valuable data or large sums of money. Phishing is just one type of social engineering—a class of ‘human hacking’ tactics and attacks that use psychological manipulation to tempt or pressure people into taking unwise actions.\n",
            "Insider Threats: They are threats that originate with authorized users—employees, contractors, business partners—who intentionally or accidentally misuse their legitimate access, or have their accounts hijacked by cybercriminals. Insider threats can be harder to detect than external threats because they have the earmarks of authorized activity, and are invisible to antivirus software, firewalls and other security solutions that block external attacks. One of the more persistent cybersecurity myths is that all cybercrime comes from external threats. In fact, according to a recent study, 44% of insider threats are caused by malicious actors, and the average cost per incident for malicious insider incidents in 2022 was USD 648,062.3 Another study found that while the average external threat compromises about 200 million records, incidents involving an inside threat actor resulted in exposure of one billion records or more.\n",
            "Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks: A DDoS attack attempts to crash a server, website or network by overloading it with traffic, usually from a botnet—a network of multiple distributed systems that a cybercriminal hijacks by using malware and remote-controlled operations. The global volume of DDoS attacks spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasingly, attackers are combining DDoS attacks with ransomware attacks, or simply threatening to launch DDoS attacks unless the target pays a ransom."
        ],
        conclusion: "The cyber threats outlined above represent just a fraction of the challenges facing individuals and organizations in our increasingly connected world. Each type of threat has its unique characteristics and methods of attack, but all share a common goal: to exploit vulnerabilities for gain or disruption.\nUnderstanding these threats is crucial for developing effective defense strategies. As cybercriminals continue to evolve their tactics, so too must our approaches to cybersecurity. It's not only about protecting data but also about safeguarding operational integrity and maintaining trust in digital systems. By staying informed and vigilant, implementing robust security measures, and fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness, we can mitigate the risks posed by these formidable adversaries.",

            "Physical Security: Don’t leave devices visible to anyone passing your home, or in your car when you are out and about. If a device is stolen it could be easily hacked into by a cyber criminal, particularly if you haven’t secured it with a strong password.",
            "Home Network: Your home network includes all data that is transmitted via the broadband router your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has provided you with, and all the devices connected to it via a network cable or Wi-Fi. It's important to familiarise yourself with how this device works, because all of the devices you use connect to it. If your network router is not secure, this affects your entire home network.",
            "Wi-Fi: You should change the default Wi-Fi password on your router to a strong password that is also easily remembered by you and other members of your household. Make sure that you use 'WPA2' or 'WPA3' as your network encryption method. f you use lots of smart devices like speakers, lightbulbs and appliances, consider setting them up on a separate network so that they are kept separate from devices that store private data, such as your PC.",
            "Anti-Virus and Firewalls: Anti-virus software helps to protect your devices from malware such as viruses and spyware. Firewalls help to secure the data that is transmitted over your home network as well as data being sent and received over the Internet. These are two key tools to protect the devices in your home from any harmful activity by cyber criminals.",
            "Surfing the Internet: Use an up to date browser. Check the address bar to make sure you are on the correct website you intended to visit. When shopping online it is good practice to limit visits to reputable brands that you know or have heard of before, and if in doubt, ask a friend or check out reviews of a website before proceeding with an order.
